# Bluenile

- A fallen being, trapped in the branches of an evergreen tree - 


Blue Nile was started in mid-November as a late Nanowrimo project. Obviously I didn't achieve that goal, so it instead became a project that I predict will take about 5 months to complete. It is to be scripted and programmed with Ink + Unity. It is intended to be 4 parts, possibly around 40 - 50K words, which is about short or medium length for a text game. 

This game will have a minimalist pixel art style with animated scenes for each chapter and events, with monochromatic character headshots commissioned from -insert future artist name-. The ambient chiptune soundtrack was composed by me.

Blue Nile is a supernatural thriller about a man who has murdered his father: a charismatic priest, veteran, and former athelete who manipulates his town into believing that the game's eponymous river can grant ever lasting life.
