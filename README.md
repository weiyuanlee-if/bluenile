# Bluenile

- A fallen being, trapped in the branches of an evergreen tree - 


Blue Nile was started in mid-November as a late Nanowrimo project. I didn't achieve that goal, so it instead became a serial project. Individual episodes will be released as text novels in Ink with Javascript. The complete novel will be made in Ink + Unity. It is intended to be 4 parts, possibly around 40 - 50K words.
